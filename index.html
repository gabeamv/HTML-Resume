        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Gabriel Villanueva and I am from Southern California. As of June 11, 2023, 
            I am a third year Computer Science major studying at California State 
            University, Long Beach. I plan on graduating in the Spring of 2025. I am doing a lot of 
            self-studying and I aim to have an internship before I graduate. Right now, I am 
            trying to figure out which fields in Computer Science I would like to pursue in.
            Right now, I am thinking about Machine Learning, App Development, Web Development,
            Databases, Operating Systems, and Ethical Hacking. My goal for the next two years,
            2023 and 2024, is to keep learning and gain experience in various fields to figure 
            out which field is right for me.
